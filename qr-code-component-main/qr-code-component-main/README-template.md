## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties

### What I learned

I mainly learned that patience is key. Its okay to get stuck and look things up or try different things. I referred back to my spreadsheet notes a lot. 

```html
The HTML was very basic and I barely added anything there is nothing crazy to show for it. The CSS however was annoying to do for this for it being a "beginner" challenge. It took me a while to figure out how to properly style the qr code image but eventually I figured it out while looking at screenshots from my previous practice code. 
```
```css
.qr-card img {
    width: 90%;
    border-radius: 12px;
    margin: 21px;
}
```

### Continued development

I struggle a lot with CSS semantics and selectors that is something I need to work on. 


### Useful resources

Honestly I just winged it and used my own notes.
